---------------------------------
1. mind array boundary
2. use center point to discuss even/odd array
3. use substring to print partial string
4. test_case:"ac", print a

## DP solution needs to be reviewed
## spanning solution
1. odd/even array number in for loop, in helper function, we first define the bounday left >= 0 && right < length 
if char(left) == char(right), two pointers expand
and then new string = substring(left + 1, right), because the condition on the left is failed, needs to smaller
