# Rotation-related
1. please be careful of the rotation times K might exceed the totalLength, therefore, K should be modulo totalLength.
### LC-61: 
1. connect the tail node to the head; to form a loop
2. find the new head node, and then break up the point
### LC-189
1. three step reverse can form O(1) space complexity
